# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App! This is a simple yet powerful application built with React that helps you manage your tasks efficiently.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the application here: [React Todo App](https://react-todo-app-beta-self.vercel.app/). You can explore its features and see how it works in real-time.

## Features

The Todo App comes with a variety of features to enhance your task management experience:

1. **Add Todo**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
2. **Edit Todo**: Modify existing tasks to keep your list up to date.
3. **Mark Todo as Complete**: Track your progress by marking tasks as completed.
4. **Delete Todo**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

## Local Setup

To set up the Todo App locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. Download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- **npm**: The Node package manager, which is included with Node.js. It allows you to install and manage dependencies for your project. Alternatively, you can use Yarn as a package manager.

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone <this-repo's url>
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and install the required dependencies using npm or Yarn:

```bash
$ cd <repo-directory> # Change to the repository directory
$ npm install # or yarn install
```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
$ npm start # or yarn start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser, and you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
